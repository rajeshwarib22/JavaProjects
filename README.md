# JavaProjects

1. Imperial Particles : This project revolves around the concept of Imperial Particles, inspired by the Star Wars universe, which serve as a crucial energy source for powering the Death Star. These particles are distributed across a quantum map, and their types are determined by their respective locations on the map. The project focuses on identifying the type of particle based on its coordinates and characteristics. It is implemented by using basic java concepts like conditional statments, looping sttamentes, instance and static variavbles and methods.


2. Computer Viruses : This project demonstrates the core concept of OOP using Java like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation. The project creates synthetic data about three types of viruses called alpha, beta and gamma. The data teels more about how the viruses are triggered, whats their size and whats their payload.

3. Pokemon Wars : This project demonstrate the war between 3 water and 3 fire pokemons. The pokemons are selected randomly and they fight 3 times giving us the result which pokemon won. It also demonstrates the core concept of OOP using Java like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.
